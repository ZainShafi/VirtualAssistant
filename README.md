# VirtualAssistant
Hello Everyone! This project is kind of a clone of Alexa and Siri which serve as Virtual Assistants. You can talk to the system directly and give commands like playing a video on
YouTube, searching something on Wikipedia or even asking the system to crack jokes!
There are several packages to be imported before running the project. You can install these packages in your editor using the following commands:
1) pip install SpeechRecognition
2) pip install pyttsx3
3) pip install PyAudio----if this command shows error then use this command:
----pip install pipwin
----pipwin install pyaudio
4) pip install pywhatkit
5) pip install wikipedia
6) pip install pyjokes
The Code is pretty simple and easy to understand! All the Best and Happy Coding!
